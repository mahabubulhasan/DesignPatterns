# DesignPatterns
Design Patterns in .Net Core context using C#

## Creational Patterns

- [Factory Method](./Factory/README.md) _(Creates an instance of several derived classes)_
- [Abstract Factory](./AbstractFactory/README.md) _(Creates an instance of several families of classes)_
- [Builder](./Builder/README.md) _(Separates object construction from its representation)_
- [Prototype](./Prototype/README.md) _(A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned)_
- Object Pool _(Creates an instance of several families of classes)_
- Singleton _(A class of which only a single instance can exist)_

## Structural Patterns

- Adapter _(Match interfaces of different classes)_
- Bridge _(Separates an object's interface from its implementation)_
- Composite _(A tree structure of simple and composite objects)_
- [Decorator](./Decorator/README.md) _(Add responsibilities to objects dynamically)_
- Facade _(A single class that represents an entire subsystem)_
- Flyweight _(A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing)_
- Private Class Data _(Restricts accessor/mutator access)_
- Proxy _(An object representing another object)_

## Behavioral Patterns

- Chain of responsibility _(A way of passing a request between a chain of objects)_
- Command _(Encapsulate a command request as an object)_
- Interpreter _(A way to include language elements in a program)_
- Iterator _(Sequentially access the elements of a collection)_
- Mediator _(Defines simplified communication between classes)_
- Memento _(Capture and restore an object's internal state)_
- [Observer](./Observer/README.md) _(A way of notifying change to a number of classes)_
- Null Object _(Designed to act as a default value of an object)_
- State _(Alter an object's behavior when its state changes)_
- [Strategy](./Strategy/README.md) _(Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class)_
- Template Method _(Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass)_
- Visitor _(Defines a new operation to a class without change)_
